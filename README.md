# UserSegmentation


This project aims to develop user segments to aid future marketing strategies and to improve products. We combine the user survey and the usage data to understand the underlying user patterns. 

Using a clustering algorithm, dimension reudction algorithms, and Natural Language processing, we successfully divide users into two groups. 

5102 users are identified to be in Group 0 and other 977 users are identified to be in Group 1. The average values of motivation level, commitment level, and other factors indicating active engagement are all observed higher in Group 1. Group 1 can be considered loyal, more profitable, or at least potentially more profitable users. 

We explore the behavior differences and compare the statistics of each group. 

We also present several ideas that can be relevant for making informed decisions.
